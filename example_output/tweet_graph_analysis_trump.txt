0.776 @ellenskinner: as i recall, you blocked key witnesses from testifying.
0.772 @BlineAnalytica: why are you complaining about witnesses?  the whole point is that democrats want witnesses at trial.
0.772 @Graceann319: either moscow mitch agrees to witnesses or no trial, period! that's how trials work, you hear from witnesses on both sides.
0.766 @2205TCS: you are so guilty and if not, let your people testify #impotus
0.765 @KarolGarnett: if the sen. majority leader asked for witnesses you could prove this! push him!!!
0.760 @judsonhh: how about allowing your staff to testify on your behalf! clear it all right up!
0.759 @NMBAJV: let bolton and others testify then if you’re so innocent.  turn over requested documents too.
0.754 @jmegrl100: you will do anything to prevent 1st hand witnesses from testifying.
0.751 @jspowers: it’s your trial, dumbass, if you have witnesses who canclear you then you should present them.
0.748 @USABeReady: if so unfair, let mulvaney, pompeo &amp; bolton testify under oath to clear his name. my bad...he’s guilty
0.747 @ahay723: come on blowhard, step up to the plate and testify yourself!  why won’t you let anyone testify?  you’re guilty that’s why!
0.747 @SouthJaxBeach: bring first-hand witnesses to the senate and bury the dems heresay. #doubledogdare
0.746 @MDeanCaudill: if trump's innocent, then why isn't he asking for witnesses from his administration?
0.742 @janahyde1: no, apparently it’s republicans who’ll do anything to keep witnesses from testifying that might implicate you.
0.741 @bbmbsit: mulvaney and bolton need to testify on your behalf!
0.738 @MP_Spears: seems to me you refused to send any witnesses or lawyers when asked. i know memory loss is tough.
0.738 @notdarealjoker: why can’t witnesses testify then, mr. innocent? only guilty people block testimony, dotard.
0.737 @romangirl10: if your call was so perfect, why didn't you testify when you had the chance, president mccrybaby?  #removetrump
0.736 @TrumpMockery: let your witnesses testify!  what are you hiding?
0.731 @ckjohnston1: it was such a *perfect* letter that you should definitely testify. your testimony will also be *perfect*.
0.729 @45LiesAlot: first, you and those previously subpoenaed should offer full testimony under oath to the house. then we can talk.
0.719 @FBCoachMill: you obstructed the house investigation and blocked witnesses and documents...remember?
0.718 @scarolinatweet: no we want to hear witnesses and see documents you insist on keeping hidden!!!!!!!!! why’s that???
0.710 @DennisDarrow: it’s fucking overwhelming and when your henchmen testify you’ll be toast!
0.709 @CHALD16: #moscowmich is holding up the senate trial now - probably not his best move
0.708 @Davafletter: you couldn’t be more wrong. dems want a trial. gaslighting again.
0.701 @guano_col: let mulvaney, bolton, etc testify. the truth is your friend.
0.701 @TrueJamesWoods: but you want witnesses too, to exonerate you right.
0.694 @CMWood42: hmmm.  federalist papers.  founders thinking on senate as the “trial court” for impeachment’s.
0.694 @LegalJackI: because the house was an investigation and impeachment and the senate is a trial. you really need to learn the constitution
0.682 @MomOfTwins57: then let your people testify and stop hiding the truth
0.675 @Carrie32794279: i’d like to see this go to trial.i want hear  guilani.see the documents if your innocent hand them over donald

0.669 @Americanjusti14: testify creep . either testify or shut up
0.667 @MomRovin: why won’t you let michael duffey testify?
0.665 @SojournadaTruth: i guess bolton will testify...to help clear things up.
0.664 @tiredsab1: because moscow mitch decided before the trial began.  resign.
0.661 @greywolfmoon3: let's talk about all those documents that you refused to turn over?
0.659 @pineapplepolis: "mcconnell says he has enough gop votes to proceed with a senate impeachment trial"
0.652 @Leonfeder: i pray that you get impeached and that the senate convicts you.
0.648 @DeLaHay14534: so, when it happens i'm sure you'll be testifying, right?
0.644 @BeltwayPanda: outing whistleblowers and stifling witnesses are not things that innocent men do.
0.643 @BarbMUL99853898: you ordered that no one testify and your lawyers refused to come. remember. you can't win the game if you don't play
0.642 @james_evy: more like making sure #moscowmitch doesn't stack the senate kangaroo court with too many marsupials.
0.636 @ZCroatia58: let's see what first hand bolton has to say....now that's some fine revenge...cant wait!!!
0.635 @TheShad95882894: they invited you to testify. you refused.  stop whining.
0.634 @CognitiveCaveat: you withheld this information and ignored the subpoena.  that's obstruction.
0.625 @nisancerami: thank you for signing it, the senate for not blocking it, and the house of representatives for writing it for us!
0.623 @poliagno1: read the transcripts. you should. they prove you are guilty.
0.621 @rick_huggins10: just more noise from any carnival clown.  produce your witnesses, genius ‼️
0.619 @carinasmum1: again! it wasn’t a trial. the trial happens in the senate, not in the house.
0.607 @DoodDogs: so if a senate vote was “totally partisan” then exonerating you would be a hoax as well.
0.607 @CarrieRFisher: good try! let's see mulvaney, bolton, pompeo, rudy, and pence first!
0.600 @jyroc16: i would love to see you on trial 🤥🤗
0.594 @denbighchic: i think you will be on trial before democrats are cheez whiz
0.590 @MyGuitarThing: nah...the senate can't do that until the house transmits the articles
0.586 @retire411: you going to have your fat ass testify?
0.586 @Eggicus: cant be thrown out of office unless the senate votes majority
0.584 @AleTheBelly: let me explain it to you, there were no witnesses because you blocked them dumbfart
0.580 @seth_yoder: the trial happens in the senate, not the house, you dotard.
0.575 @SueKelsonEvents: if there was a secret vote 35 rep senators would ask for your removal
