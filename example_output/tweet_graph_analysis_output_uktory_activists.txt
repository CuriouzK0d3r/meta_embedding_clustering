==================
0.916 @Lordbrexit: tory party using intimidation to get us to stand down in remaining seats.  vote brexit party now and not tory to remove labour.
0.914 @McFc_Winners: to late for that, a vote for the brexit party is a vote for labour.
0.910 @Lordbrexit: why would brexiteers vote for the tory party who are supporting remain.  when they can vote for the brexit party.
0.903 @Chris27657780: where there is a brexit party ppc standing, vote for the brexit party, where there is not, vote tory.
0.895 @evosteve1340: no deal would be my preference, but the choice in my pit-village constituency will be the (sitting) ‘leave’ conservative  or labour. i’d suggest any brexit voter in a labour/lib marginal or with a remoaner tory to vote brexit party. tactical voting will win the day for brexit.
0.891 @tonyedwardson: vote conservative get brino. vote brexit party get brexit.
0.888 @CoyleLeyla: see brexit party , vote brexit party.  if not vote conservative
0.881 @andymack2019: realistically only johnson or corbyn can be pm if you want brexit vote tory if you don’t vote labour
0.874 @DayTimeTony: "will cost us brexit"? if 17.4m people vote the brexit party it won't.
0.865 @dwm220263: not so tricky. where the cons can't beat labour, they should stand aside for the bp. the aim is to get a strong con majority, get rid of remoaner mps in leave areas, and reduce labour's vote in safe seats with the brexit party. the more labour loses, the less seats the cons need
0.859 @TweetingLND: if its a marginal tory seat or tories are within a few thousand votes (say under 3k) you should probably vote conservatives to stop a remoaner getting the seat.  elsewhere vote brexit party
0.857 @SayNoToLabour10: if the brx &amp; tory parties split the leave vote in labour heartlands, labour might just cling onto some.
0.855 @TheOnlyGuru: i think the safest option is to vote conservative, it’s not looking too clever pour brexit party, which is a ruddy shame.
0.854 @anoldbaglady: general election 2019: brexit party will not stand in tory seats, says nigel farage
0.854 @annerosefernan1: well done boris . we are voting for you and the conservative party . get brexit done 👍👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
0.854 @MJBr00ks58: conservative but only because i have no choice to vote brexit party.
0.852 @MRL8899: so you're saying everyone of them brexit party voters would consider voting tory ?
0.849 @RogerDe11266543: understandably. vote brexit party in this case. get brexit done, continue the squabble afterwards.
0.846 @GaryEva49192212: torie remoaners are stopping brexit. dont vote for remoaner mps. we need leave mps in parliament
0.844 @BrexitKite: breaking news - brexit party not standing against sitting conservative mps  nigel is putting #countrybeforeparty

0.842 @jjasq: how tory voters switching to the brexit party could deliver another hung parliament | brexitcentral
0.842 @Magman55: would be a great leader of the labour party.  but personally, i would still vote for the brexit party.
0.839 @MrToryLuke: i don't care whether tory candidates voted remain as long as they back boris's brexit deal!
0.837 @proud_remoaner: please please vote brexit party 👍
0.836 @PaulC54368423: boris will not be blamed or be held accountable for failing to achieve his positive effort to get brexit by the 31oct , but the remoaner mps betraying their voters and the speaker berkow will be !! across the parties &amp; country !!!
0.836 @BabushkaThe: by all means be indulgent and spoil your vote if you think brexit is a done deal...
0.835 @corwallnick: brexit party is taking labour votes in the labour heartlands. lose bxp and we may lose brexit altogether.
0.834 @AusAntiLeft: it'll end up being a conservative minority government relying on brexit party for confidence and supply?
0.833 @James4Leave: i live in manchester and will 100% not vote tory however i will 100% vote for the brexit party.

0.828 @krystynastark: brexit party but my candidate has stood down so have to vote tory
0.827 @GrovePortland: not even? he remain or career or tory candidates then?  seems to me the risk of voting in a tory closet remoaner is still high then. i got boles as mp last time..  not falling for that trickery from the bilderberg tories again.  i need no app, i need brexit. plain and simple.
0.827 @Lordbrexit: no because if 17.4 million had voted brexit party the whole swamp would have been cleaned out.
0.827 @Creight69106619: but your "brexit deal" is fake brexit. only the brexit party is offering true brexit.

0.818 @mariagrindle7: the north have been ignored for too long labour are finished the brexit party will wipe labour out

0.804 @MadPdavid: jo swinson is a big problem for us tories she’s killing the lib dem vote. we need a clegg to split the remain vote
0.803 @judebrexitqueen: no thanks, i don't trust boris, plus if he was serious about leaving then he would do a pact with the brexit party

0.789 @EdReed10596364: brino peddlers (tories) are just another form of remoaner, so there’s absolutely no point in voting for them.  they can avoid this at any time by committing to no deal instead, this is what they must do if they want brexiteer votes.  it’s their call 🤷🏻‍♂️

0.858 @davidjbiscoe: i think in terms of tactical voting they mean if tories run your constituency vote tory. if its labour vote tbp. it becomes a challenge if the tory is a remoaner then you'd vote tbp

0.810 @JustNormalChap: unless the conservative is a remoaner or wants a soft brexit in which case replacing with brexit party is essential. tories will delay and not deliver #wtobrexit if we don’t replace the blue traitors!
0.808 @MofS_Legend: maybe because in the voters did decide #brexit and their vote was trashed?
0.806 @Benevolentallt1: you are splitting the leave vote. step aside, it’s now clear a vote for you is a wasted vote

0.780 @AmpersZA: don't knock it mate! that's the figures we leavers want. it will drive ours to vote but make the opposition complacent.

0.736 @jonnyboy2021: #loughborough vote  and the tories. dodge the danger that a corbyn government would bring 😱😱😱😱
0.734 @Douglas85795014: watch: dawn butler mistakenly endorses boris johnson
0.733 @nibbler11: well, that and jeremy corbyn is senile bigot with nonsensical policies maybe?
0.730 @rixypullan: yeh but do you want brexit or corbyn plus remain?
0.727 @0_politics2: nope getting rid of corbyn and giving the tories a majority is what i want
0.724 @JohnTAlcock1: so, so funny. now it's the russians fault that corbyn is an arse.
0.720 @LewLUFCforlife: why hasn’t the media published this, the anti boris campaign continues, absolute disgrace
0.718 @Godfrey28482926: the only way we will now get brexit is by supporting boris.
0.718 @Ara_MaHubbard: what's going on with bojo, can't shut up. corbyn is just corbyn, not really consistent.
0.714 @RockinBluesFan: what idiots are still talking about 'crashing out' with boris' deal?
0.711 @ManMitchin: are you following your bias bbc colleagues by boris bashing?? not good
0.711 @Christo43797769: wot a dick.. blaming boris wots boris got to do with it

0.701 @2112Frankie: you are prepared to give up brexit and usher in a corbyn government. no going back after that you fool.
0.700 @sandieshoes: brexit party candidate in workington agrees with backing boris 💁
0.695 @FluffiesR: because of your attitude i believe we will now end up with a corbyn led government!
0.693 @SteveGsRightPeg: not a fair balance for boris here. full of anti tory wankers
0.692 @wilma19504412: didn’t realise emily thornberry was a tory opps no she isn’t she labour..... pass it on 👍
0.686 @gamtastical: oops. lying again. corbyn the liar found out, again.
0.685 @MaureenDalby: agree...but just cannot let corbyn win...am having nightmares that he might!!!!
0.685 @BrexitBanter52: i want a rerun of the ge if boris loses then
0.684 @attorney2050: hang on, nigel tried to unite and was rudely spurned by boris.
0.681 @Jw96934043: i have been corrected though.  it is historically labour led councils pre corbyn as well
0.680 @teresadg0: a bit like labour supporters since corbyn became leader ? 😁
0.675 @TheHopeSprings: spin this whichever way you want, but corbyn does not exemplify a strong leader #generalelection2019
0.672 @rogerlilley: in fairness to bruce she will have been instructed to interrupt boris by her bosses.
0.667 @BelieveInDemoc2: has he accused other people of scaremongering yet labour are still lying about the nhs?
0.666 @Simo81407001: boris is a secret remainer. he’s a disgrace
0.661 @PeterCoborn: that's too benign.  our future would be wretched if labour won.  we'd be bankrupt and defenceless.
0.656 @Cleverhardy99: oh. you mean like boris johnson?
0.653 @BARSONMARS: that's a fact that is not being talked about  whilst the lying labour "papers" are a complete fabrication.
0.649 @Michael36496119: jez corbyn.. the ira useful idiot
0.642 @MarkACropper: watching it. waste of my fkuncig time realy. my impression so far? boris is creeping ahead. not that it matters.
0.635 @takeusout_lynda: well you can include gmb as they were in destroy boris mode too today
0.633 @Janineplenty1: it's not boris its farage hes his own worst enemy
0.631 @NeverAg55190688: it's quite clear that many of the labour party's own staff members are disgusted by #labourantisemitism.

0.561 @Lewip811: nice deflection there from the fact the ira was defeated 👍
0.561 @Cleisthenes6: the irony of course being that she is knowingly lying when she repeats this allegation
0.552 @semence: you're thanking her for telling an obvious lie? despicable.
0.548 @0_politics2: they are the best bet at sorting it out, we already know labour would pretty much abolish borders
0.531 @Lordbrexit: but do you trust them?  they have a track record of lying.
0.520 @BobbyBrexit1: you know how you can tell she's lying?  her moustache has flecks of sh*t in it

0.775 @JustNormalChap: brexit party in conservative seats where the mp is a remoaner or wants a soft brexit/customs union. much better to have 300 tory and 50 brexit party mps than say 340 and 10. we can’t trust boris and need bp in coalition to deliver a #wtobrexit

0.764 @PaulSte67312330: you live in a remoaner area then lol  nige is turning people like me away from his party so he has a major problem, when people like me are gonna vote tory the brexit party is in proper trouble.  the way nige is behaving its like nige has a pact with corbyn tbh
0.763 @OlleLemon: don’t vote for populist like the brexit party. please.
0.760 @my_amigouk: tax cuts, apprenticeships, stopping brexit: parties court business vote
0.759 @Chris27657780: where there is a brexit party ppc standing vote for the brexit party. where there is not vote tory.
0.757 @RFreeUK_Listen: better an honest remoaner than a supporter of a fake brexit deal... #saynotobrino never trust a tory.
0.756 @cwsmith1: i don't think they are going for the leave vote it's a cynical ploy to grab as many remainiacs as they can
0.754 @Fhkierton1: what do i do if there's no brexit party to vote for when i go to vote??
0.754 @realTonyBurgess: brexit party. would vote for britain if they were running.
0.752 @OharrahScarlett: come on labour heartlands give us some bxp mps. brexit needs them badly.
0.752 @Loreign83: watch "nigel farage furious brexit party mep rupert lowe decides to quit elections" on youtube
0.746 @AudioKid3: as  republican socialist i will be voting tactically to defeat any unionists party....
0.745 @AllanJGreen: nope. still voting brexit party.
0.745 @EmiIyThornberry: you sound like a common racist bigot who votes for the brexit party that's why
0.740 @PaulSte67312330: what labour really thinks of brexit voters
0.740 @0_politics2: what a joke those questions were, the only decent ones were on brexit and anti-semitism, both of which corbyn messed up on
0.739 @Suewilk80870983: it's also the arrogance of farage wanting his way. no compromise. country before party
0.736 @BobbyWi42273330: 😂😂😂you wanker😂😂😂  *** remember a vote for labour is a vote for islamic extremists ***
0.735 @DMB12445: i'm spoiling my vote so it is counted.  tory remainer seat.
0.733 @Lordbrexit: totally agree but the brexit party seems to have given up.
0.730 @JeSuisTinkerbel: boris, trying to persuade true leavers that his deal is brexit...
0.729 @Bexbel: i think he knew this was his next step &amp; why he didn't stand as brexit party mp.
0.728 @SheronC01571447: i hope they do win some seats, just not splitting the leave vote to let labour win, esp yvette cooper
0.728 @Trixyliz: vote conservative if you want to leave the eu.
0.727 @SemperTyrannis: sorry, i no longer believe the conservative party has the spine or will to walk away.
0.727 @fairdealplease: so many candidates stood down to support the conservative party.  the super rich, establishment.
0.724 @daisy_ljmartin4: ‘member of the public’ who heckled farage is labour party association chairman  via
0.723 @LadyVauxhall: was never anything but a remoaner; her entire disastrous premiership was dedicated to neutralising brexit.  she was a fraud.
0.722 @MikeWarrington7: and soooooo many ex labour members have said do not vote for labour!!!!!
0.721 @YeshuaBenDavid4: no brexit candidate; tory. also, tories will win here.
0.721 @LeeFlem07332822: i'm voting for the brexit party and still donating and campaigning for them
0.720 @BadgerFool: please consider your options, labour held seats for example are far more likely to switch to bxp than tory, particularly in the north.  handing a weak brexiteer seat to a remoaner out of pure belligerence would be insanity.
0.720 @Zigzagwanderer3: on the day, in the polling booth, when the choice is stark, bxp support will evaporate.
0.720 @packetsniffer99: i suppose depends if you want to leave the eu or not. bp will not win a single seat.
0.719 @PaulLan48134456: they sent an antisemite to to go out and defend an antisemite  the labour party folks
0.718 @TheBlackHorseD5: bit nigel wouldnt vote for boris deal so were back to square one
0.718 @DavidHadley1973: ukip says lets get brexit done.  dont split the brexiteer vote.

0.715 @Lordbrexit: i would have to spoil my vote.  because the indy where i live is really a labour supporter.
0.714 @FrenchyStu: david gauke fell out with the tories.   he still wants brexit.
0.712 @glenncarringto2: desperate or what ??  when are you remoaner losers going to accept a democratic decision to leave the eu.....the people voted to leave 52-48 ,accept defeat gracefully !!!
0.712 @pjpaterson3: well hopefully the loser islamic labour party will never get elected so we won’t have to find out.
0.712 @rog3000: a general election will see the back of enough remoaner scum to enable us to move forward and have the brexit we voted for.  you can't run and hide forever.
0.710 @GaryEva49192212: more muslim voters in britain than jewish. think that is why labour party have become antisemitic??
0.710 @Jen_Joesbury: i’m not actually, although you did get the remoaner part right. i don’t think they should be allowed to vote, but saying they should only be allowed to vote if they are contributing to the economy is not a fair argument when you have adults that don’t contribute allowed to vote
0.710 @pancheri_fiona: not happy at all that you’ve been so damn arrogant as to try to bribe bp candidates. not good boris
0.709 @speckyduck: remind me how much was wasted in no deal brexit planning? paying off the dup?
0.709 @Lothark8: agree with everything.  a peoples vote must only contain deal / no deal.    remain should not appear on the ballot sheet 😁
0.708 @29Barters: you've suggested anyone who votes for labour is antisemitic.
0.708 @Healthsafetyhse: why would police monitor the guys activities? do they do that for conservative party members also.
0.707 @lindakeyes14: so i guess by that reasoning, those who vote corbyn support the ira!
0.706 @everest_robert: yes well, 17.4m of us voted to remain in 1975 and now you're trying to overturn that.
0.705 @razorblue: bbc are propaganda arm for labour party and extremist environmentalist types
0.704 @diddly1525: i've voted tory, my postal vote already returned. its a tory held seat with an mp who supports leave.
0.702 @HellawellJudith: this should say brexit party but it was altered by my stupid remoaner tablet!
0.701 @justifiablyjack: jeremy corbyn has just said labour is a party of experts!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0.697 @meowsdavies: so "remoaner" has become an insult against people who don't want to leave the eu still lol
0.696 @DemocratWorld: prepare for the avalanche of propaganda from the bbc c4 itv and sky promoting the anti brexit parties - it's their last chance to stop a proper brexit. shameful, yes, corrosive to our democracy, yes, but the remoaner elites that run things don't care they just want their own way
0.696 @infoukphotodis1: well done nigel, the only party wanting a real leave...
0.695 @suzejm63: what about traditional labour voters ? should they think again about voting for a marxist terrorist sympathiser ?
0.695 @TheBIueCity: northern ireland voted to remain. leaving the eu could be disastrous for ni
0.693 @Dean1926: maybe ukip voters wanted to leave the eu.
0.692 @LesleyM93753836: please to hear 👂 from you brexit party 🎉 london emma stockdale

0.692 @TomVeiga1: i want you to be the next labour leader. you'd be an excellent choice to lose the next election.
0.691 @JonPegasus: jeremy corbyn condemned by labour peer on defence: 'he sides with terrorists!'
0.691 @mikeleigh33: our seat is a marginal swing seat between conservative/liebour with a liebour remoaner currently the mp. if it wasn’t so marginal i’d definitely vote bxp, but this time it’s conservative
0.690 @BrexitPenny: so labour literally want to beat people up to force them to vote for them! brutal dictatorship much?
0.690 @Abbots_Syrup: that face did it. who on earth would vote for that political numpty? 😂😂
0.689 @Corbettdc2134: there is a deal but those remoaner numpties are going to destroy the deal by amendments and there is a strong possibility that we will go out on no deal now.
0.689 @darkfarces: if it was simple it would be done by now. only the conservatives can keep the brexit project alive now.
0.689 @BillyBusby4: fear corbyn more than brexit ans with good cause
0.688 @trickytree2: nicely  put, sadly i admit i am one that as got to vote tory to try and keep labour out
0.688 @gregbra34492271: omg can anyone really vote for corbyn after watching that?
0.686 @Norman24383615: pathetic attempt by labour, snp and jo swinson and remoaner’s that people over 65 will not allowed to vote in the general election as they will know what they are voting for.  but school kids can because they won’t  know what they are voting for.
0.686 @SteveGosforth: oh yes please because   2015 - 8,135 majority 2017 - 1,097 majority 2019 - let's hope the undemocratic remoaner loses the seat - she lost over 7,000 votes in 2 years and people have really been able to see how she's delayed and made the process a total misery  bye bye joanna
0.685 @larrson39: name your 3 favourite tory policies...excluding getting brexit done 😂😂...and stopping indy 2...
0.683 @Simo81407001: vote brexit party for a true clean break brexit 🇬🇧🇬🇧
0.680 @AdeleWard: it's the 70% remain voters in this constituency going for the unite to remain candidate.
0.680 @peter_goldwing: if there is a brexit party candidate, vote for them! you know it makes sense!
0.679 @FrankCarberry: listening to that lot make me more likely to vote labour.
0.679 @TCM51x: it's hardly brain surgery. give away your no.1 bargaining chip &amp; the opposition have you over a barrel.  exactly what first #theresamay then remoaner #parliament have done!  eu couldn't believe their luck. stupid british politicians.  that's about to change with ge.
0.679 @pjpaterson3: unless your a muslim in which case you get it for free by voting loser islamic labour party.
0.679 @KevinJAlderton1: don't be silly, if they do we will demand a peoples confirmatory vote. they set the president.. ☺

0.677 @ianmcco92394185: welcome to the leave train vote boris
0.677 @MrToryLuke: they'll vote labour or lib dem because they view centre-right parties as anti-immigrant.
0.676 @JenFullick: you should be totally disgusted with yourself, as we, the people are disgusted at you. you are the cause of the complete loss of confidence in remoaner mps. you will be directly responsible when they all lose their seats. you are a disgrace to the positions you have held
0.676 @Shipmoney1637: if the tories win this will accelerate exponentially as brexit will be a settled matter.
0.675 @Benevolentallt1: because they knew it would be predominantly labour focused and would further their political strategy to support corbyn
0.675 @AlastairWeston: many saying the youth element is being exaggerated as an impact , awful choice , i think corbyn will form a coalition
0.674 @andy11575245: bxp fourth behind labour here, tories have chance of beating plaid cymru
0.674 @0_politics2: well they are to leavers during the campaign, in the same way tories are the enemy to you
0.673 @ThePrizeForce: brexit party, doing its best stop brexit.  go figure.
0.673 @NorthernDave_: i cant wait for labour to lose and jezza refuse to stand down. the labour civil war will be amazing. #cantwaitfor2020
0.672 @delshan001: if you vote johnson here won't be any brexit either, just his brino.
0.672 @MrToryLuke: richard tice makes a great case to back boris and vote conservative!
0.671 @democracywins12: i do think boris is doing everything he can but if we don’t leave 31st october going to make it very hard to trust the tories
0.670 @SeanDailyTweets: and we won't be bullied by remoaner labour mps and the anti semite leader!
0.669 @Brexit011: so sad heather so sad. brexit sold out by the brexit party.
0.669 @teresadg0: oh dear....... the way to fight racism isn’t to support it.  by voting for it, you are, indeed supporting it.
0.668 @NWalesBrexiteer: everytime boris says #getbrexitdone hes telling you to vote #brexitparty ✅
0.668 @hector_drummond: apparently farage said they will stand against remainer mps.
0.667 @STTA75703527: unless the 17.4m #leave voters vote  the#brexit is gone forever, bye 👋🏻
0.666 @fightingb4ck: because if it’s based on labour getting out the youth vote, they will be voting for an antisemite.
0.666 @OatcakeEater: only one of those people has tried, and failed, to "enact brexit". he's the one you're backing? 🤣🤣🤣
0.665 @Mickytaker2: no i'm actively voting against my tory candidate.
0.665 @ianmcco92394185: get ready if corbyn gets in we want another vote like he wants on brexit
0.665 @Angela_C00k: it’s on record.  he voted to block brexit each time.
0.664 @hudson_alistair: wake up and back boris to get brexit done!
0.664 @grahamw1986: 😂😂😂😂😂😂 no but your lot do. opposing a policy you don't agree with and trying to overturn the result of the referendum are very different things. so pipe down and save your pending remoaner bs for somebody that actually cares or believes it.
0.663 @Helixd: agreed but imagine what you will feel if they don't agree? then remoaner mps will have a choice to make: be honest and repeal a50 or let no deal occur! how many have the cajones to walk through a lobby to repeal a50?
0.663 @11bigkahuna: who was that then? thatcher? ok i wont vote for her then👍
0.660 @SplendidTory: you cannot turn us not leaving on 31 oct as the pms fault. this was a requirement imposed by remoaner mps. get over yourself.

0.659 @RebornStamper: even more reason to not have a foreign power tell us bow to deal with terrorists
0.658 @johnknowes: that's representative democracy. doesn't matter how votes are counted. i'm off.
0.658 @Barnesy19: another shockingly biased "analysis" from ian dunt here. when he says "moderates" he means people abandoning the manifesto who never wanted #brexit are trying to stop it. when he says "radicals" he means those who wish to fulfill the promise made to the people #remoaner #brexit
0.658 @NatalieFKaye: the way their electorate vote makes me think of how people voted for robert mugabe
0.658 @Sandi30212426: stop slagging like the rest and get on with your manifesto if you want our vote, dont join the ces pool..
0.657 @Howarth1918: falling ld vote doesn’t immediately mean support for anti semitic stalinists

0.653 @MoonTr1cks: i bet you think exactly the same when it's labour mps he does it to.
0.653 @0_politics2: exactly! if we have a chance to get brexit done and get rid of corbyn then my god we need to take it
0.652 @weloveleave: i would have spoiled if i wasn't standing. there is no way i could live with myself if gave boris a mandate for his deal.

0.819 @DMB12445: non of the above.  brexit party for me but i have a remainer tory so will be spoiling my vote.
0.805 @ba19974: please stand down and defeat the remain labour party
0.790 @GutteridgeLinda: no vote boris for a majority, we.need to get brexit done
0.789 @george157389: the bxp would risk a corbyn government revoking a50, and so remaining in the eu, just to worry the tories? i don't think so! as to the tories standing down to help the bxp, that would be a gift to labour who would portray the tories as weak. hence bxp should target remoaner mps.
0.789 @Huggies2222: car crash britain under corbyn bad enough now under the tory's do not vote for either vote brexit party
0.778 @MustangSwain289: “we”? there aren’t enough of you! the majority want brexit. fact!
0.772 @forza_fergie: can you read, the tories cant win in hartlepool, voting tory would get you labour in this seat. #factcheck
0.770 @shardi2209: how about the home affairs select committee on antisemitism? the only people who will be responsible for johnson are those that vote for him or those centrists who'd rather brexit than corbyn. labour has decent policies. what do the lib dems have?
0.769 @BelindaMathias: if you want brexit vote brexit party 👍
0.768 @robinbull1: completely underestimates the brexit party vote.
0.768 @UptonNash: i'm going for the brexit party as i want lobour out of the valleys.
0.767 @benjamat10: it will never happen .  the tory party and the powers in the background do not want any meaningful brexit.
0.767 @DianneHarries4: and the best way to get that is return as many brexit party candidates as possible. you know what you have to do.
0.763 @Lordbrexit: i have been waiting since i voted for the referendum party.  i could never vote tory or labour again.  both are traitors.
0.763 @DemonGza: i dont trust farage or brexit party either , i definitely do not want the treaty boris brought though.
0.761 @MrOctob83475350: the labour party will lead up until 5.00 pm then the tories will leave work and vote and sanity will prevail.
0.761 @DavidGe42682029: communist warning!! you cannot vote for labour led by corbyn.
0.760 @FuryfromtheDeep: that would drain pro-refendum voters from labour who loathe corbyn
0.759 @Lordbrexit: conservatives could split the leave vote and let labour in like last time.  brexit party in the lead.
0.759 @Godfrey28482926: "a vote for boris johnson’s conservatives is a vote for nigel farage’s politics. "  yep.  brilliant !!!!
0.758 @Nick_Boro1: as a last resort to get something through but the erg voted to get no deal through before that. if boris loses his remoaner mps he'll be forced into a coalition with the a brexit party and will have to go for no deal. that's what tories should want rather than attacking brexit
0.758 @6998103a1: no we need to have brexit party mps to keep cons on right track.
0.758 @musicmagees91: no thanks! i’m voting for the brexit party.
0.756 @whitforreal: i'm all in for voting brexit party candidates as long it doesn't get lib dem or labour elected.
0.756 @kbw1001: true so why put all the blame on tbp. the postal vote fiasco won that seat.
0.756 @BearConway: the brexit party aren’t projected to win any seats, so if you do want to leave there’s only one way.
0.754 @SuperSt81957116: let's hope it stays that way  🤞 those traditional labour voters will never vote tory, but they will vote bxp.
0.753 @JohnDG_: brexit party risking it for a labour win here! #backboris to #getbrexitdone
0.753 @JudaicaMiriam: the most important thing is that labour get trashed beyond recognition and we get some bxt party mp’s to nip at boris’s heels.
0.752 @ActionBrexit: disloyal, rebel, remainer has-been advises people to vote for other disloyal, rebel, remainers shocker!!!
0.751 @BelieveInDemoc2: working for the peoples vote. publishing them seats is just stupid
0.751 @Hillchaser: vote boris johnson or brexit is toast and your referendum win will count for nothing
0.748 @VickiPMcKellar: he doesn't want a conservative overall majority. he's a tory. what does he want?? corbyn??
0.747 @ShirleyKThomas1: ensure that we hold the tories to their brexit promises!!!
0.746 @VMaledew: yes vote tory cath, won't be hung parliament unless its fixed?🤔😉👍

0.742 @SJT1958LUFC: audience sounds like rentamob from local labour party. i think boris might be in for a rough ride.
0.740 @Tiredandtetchy: im not too worried labour will win a majority. i am worried about labour snp coalition.
0.740 @ch4ddytheowl: brexit party, live in a labour stronghold. although our councilor is conservative.
0.739 @Graysmi67004989: blame.. excuse..  you probably blame the russians for leavers voting to leave too..
0.738 @MrsMurphyFBPE: it doesn’t matter what she is carl, she’s a con, and they are all for brexit. thanks for the vote split, it makes the job of a remoaner, trying to stop this disaster policy, much easier 😉
0.738 @JohnTAlcock1: well it will dup and tories, maybe a few bp and a hard brexit. nothign to stop wto brexit end of jan now.
0.737 @raygower2: they want brexit they will lose us brexit!!!
0.737 @wayne11212: i can't be arsed finding your evidence for you.  if the referendum was seriously flawed or compromised, the peoples vote, mob, the lib dems and remoaner mps would use it as the basis for a 2nd referendum, instead of this "confirmatory" vote bollocks.
0.737 @HomeTruths111: vote for any other party and you will get corbyn #voteconservative if you want brexit
0.737 @GaryHalstead9: that's because i have a solid brexiteer mp, were it otherwise, i would be voting brexit party.
0.734 @AlisonL53554588: i would vote to tory knowing swinson she would get your vote then leave you to die an agonising death
0.734 @BrexitUK4: but if the 17.4 million who voted for #brexit in 2016 voted for  at next election, there would be no conservative mps in parliament to thwart #brexit!🤨so, the message is, vote for brexit party at next ge in all constituencies which have remoaner mps!
0.732 @packetsniffer99: all true. but so is what i said. there is no brexit without a conservative majority.
0.731 @StVitusDance: i don't have a bxp either  our mp is leave but voted for mays deal ....
0.731 @TaraJewell6: i know but with encouragement from bxp &amp; dup they will they want a clean break brexit no deal
0.731 @lokshensoupjek: to keep corbyn out i am giving up my wish to remain in europe &amp; voting conservative. it is worth the sacrifice
0.731 @dgmoore75: the laziest and most ridiculous remoaner whinge (in a strong field) of the last three years. voters who vote count. the ones who couldn’t be bothered don’t. and of those who could be bothered, 52% voted to leave. no amount of wishful thinking changes that.
0.731 @PatWill97926440: what about the contempt the eu has shown to the u.k. since the democratic leave vote?  bad faith yes.
0.730 @Medtechcerb: canterbury already a labour seat due too students vote .....they want to keep it that way
0.730 @DMB12445: and this is why tories should not get a big majority.  boris lying about his treaty
0.730 @AlisonJ34870374: it's time for 5,000,000 labour leave voters that you ignored, to vote tory, bye bye!! me included!!
0.730 @MoreJaw: neh, once brexit is delivered, the hatred for opposition remoaner mp's will dissipate - we need that anger to get those mp's voted out.  this is a terrible parliament and i dont want those same people back
0.730 @BossingitH: bxp will not win a single seat!!  stand down!  a vote for bxp is a vote for labour. very simple.
0.730 @ScarletzCaptain: of course i wouldnt vote tories if they were growing on my arse lol
0.728 @24delboy24: nigel farage clashes with labour voter over brexit on campaign trail  via
0.728 @Thelandlord5: what utter rubbish! vote with your hearts and vote for brexit in #battersea
0.726 @CotswoldsWorcs: best thing to ever happen to the tory party: corbyn should stay on even if he loses election, says unite chief
0.726 @_BrexitAlliance: its not. we need the lib dems to maintain their base, if they collapse boris will lose.
0.726 @dvsairquality: tonight is remoaner mps last chance to respect the 2016 vote before an election. if they take it they could minimise voter backlash. if not they risk electoral armageddon. #goboris
0.725 @PaulSte67312330: labour lied on brexit  now labour are lying again on tax
0.724 @Newton_Marks: it’s not relying on another party.. it’s a strategic pact to maximise votes to each party..
0.724 @Godfrey28482926: boris johnson: 'every tory election candidate has pledged to back my brexit deal'
0.724 @PaulSte67312330: labour have spat in the faces of voters, time to deal with labour at the ballot box
0.722 @sandieshoes: i beg to differ. it’s a remain constituency. tories have 20,000 majority.  put a bxp candidate in you split the vote.
0.722 @LordRobert8: conservatives should win a majority and with any bxp seats won would be a combined fight against the opposition..!!
0.720 @Ljubica1: that's fair enough. i understand. problem is, where i live we have a decent tory mp, &amp; my area is remoaner central :'( so if too many people vote tbp it will let libdems in. no chance of labour or tbp winning here, &amp; at least i know my local mp is a local man &amp; always worked hard
0.720 @jings03: without a majority boris is stuck again. that's when remainers will go for ref2.
0.720 @errjustsaying: really hoping ... got to get this bloody brexit through and a con majority is the only way now!
0.719 @Didohy17: hope tories win, but they've been dishonourable with regard to farage.
0.719 @Lordbrexit: not now farage has stood down tbp candidates without tories doing in likewise.
0.718 @Reprobate24: boris's idea of brexit is brino, sadly.
0.718 @Richard54124413: great canvassing for the candidate of the brexit party.
0.718 @Tony85485600: if she was brass-necked enough to not know why here leave voting constituents hated her, then she should know now.😎
0.717 @Oldcranky2: i wish i had a brexit party candidate to vote for
0.715 @leoseatcancer: come on boris, get involved with ending fleechold before labour take your votes, please
0.715 @Bulldog665: boris’s deal is not brexit it’s rehashed mays deal - mps backing it because it’s career before country
0.715 @inv6949: mind you. please vote snp in  constituency. getting rid of her would be worth it.
0.715 @viesvies1: more reason to vote   tories can't be trusted. ever!👇👇👇👇👇
0.714 @BobHubbuck: nicola sturgeon reveals snp will side with corbyn in commons to block boris’ brexit plans
0.714 @WesDunn9: i would like a pact chris, that remain pact is only 60 seats odd, i think they will be lucky to land a third..
0.714 @paddyH33330130: #gujarat community aren’t so stupid. they’ll vote against a racist #labour  party
0.713 @raheemk07771045: #whatbrexitmeanstome   it means implement my vote you remoaner bastards and  stop creating these useless trends.  i want my vote implemented. simple as that.
0.713 @SteveW_Leave_EU: #judgementday  labour support collapses in the north: election poll shows voters rejecting corbyn
0.713 @Hatch526: it’s a 2 horse race, it you don’t vote tory then you’re voting to remain.
0.712 @jag53298335: do the labour party think that we’re all dumb..? remain or remain..!
0.712 @KevinJAlderton1: no way wife would ever vote tory, in the blood so bxp is only viable answer. please understand not everyone has toryitus... ☺
0.711 @TweedStokes: just to point out.  anne widdecombe was urging conservtaive mp's to vote for theresa may's deal in april.
0.710 @tashunkawitko2: then you must search out tory voters and convert them .let them know about tactical voting.
0.710 @SimonLeggett5: oh, and brexit wasn't forced on us by the tories. have you forgotten we had a referendum?
0.709 @WelshCelt: i'm lending my vote to the cons once again, and i know deep down i will regret it.
0.709 @DavidCo21718911: i’d say put brexit first, vote boris
0.709 @income4lifeplus: the intransigence from tbp supporters stems from tbp themselves.  they are deliberately misinfoming people which is sad.
0.709 @ManMitchin: a vote for boris will make sure brexit happens! #voteconservative #nevercorbyn
0.709 @Lordbrexit: unless the brexit party fox is in the tory hen house, i don't trust them as far as i can throw them.
0.709 @Bee42681881: decisions, decisions. he's now trying to persuade me to vote for the labour party.  no way jerry   🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧
0.708 @davidebartoli6: i think this is a bit unfair on mr johnson. if there was ‘fraud’ involved in his abandoning the campaign pledges to stay in the sm/cu, or any other of his brexit promises, this was all down to the remoaner losers’ their insistence that brexit follow their project fear agenda.
0.708 @Lucyspeed: but i disagree that voting for any party is a wasted vote. they all count.
0.708 @ARants88: he didnt mention labour, he just said vote, corbyn took advantage.
0.708 @MarkAlbion1: migrants tend to vote labour. that's corbyn's plan.
0.706 @I__LazLunar__I: because people keep voting for tories.  stop voting tory.  stop voting libdem.  vote labour
0.705 @ClwydS: vote share in 2017: labour 50.2% conservative 44.1%  brexit polling at 6% nationally.
0.705 @AnthonySowerby2: i hope brexit party get some, they gotta, or were doomed
0.705 @Lin46222208: same with conservatives. funnily enough the brexit party wasn’t
0.704 @iainmacd0nald: at last hopefully the remoaner ideology, the idea that brexiteers are rascist imbecilic bigots and all the other totalitarian nonsense, has caused reasonable remainers to see through this and say we now want no deal we want our independence. good on them.
0.704 @newstem61: remain 3.5 year hate campaign and the remain parliament failed to deliver the will of the people.
0.702 @TangRoy17: whens the biased reporting on brexit - failing to have on brexit party! oh are your phones not working. . . !
0.699 @kimalex34879547: the ln after transition we can leave wto but need the tories to win first and win big
0.699 @lee78520924: are you a true leaver then if you would vote for labour
0.698 @amconcerned: i thought for a change i was debating with a sensible remoaner but that last comment proved i was wrong. i know it and the labour party know it, hence bottling out of a ge.
0.698 @BrexitPenny: you appear to be mixing up that list with tory policies. i think you'll find that is the labour manifesto!
0.697 @RogerBu35879962: it’s fixed my biggest fear corrupt voting how can you defeat that. it must not happen
0.697 @Stephan07128739: he’s doing anything and everything to stop ✋🏻 brexit to suit is own agenda. the people voted to leave the eu and he lets the remoaners get their way because he’s a remoaner too. yes i do know he can’t be sacked. i’m not going to argue either. why do you like him?
0.696 @BobD_1964: so what? they have all pledged to back boris and get brexit done
0.696 @BarryWe35684044: of course we are being tricked, it doesn't matter who you vote for, they're all one big party
0.696 @KevinJAlderton1: if you are in  a constituency from 2017 that has a  tory mp there won't be  bp standing so no problem
0.695 @JaneFis92011200: you can't know that, and  i want new people in parliament because i dont trust any of the current lot, boris included.
0.695 @Stevethsoundman: trying to no mention of ties  between labour party and  groomers
0.694 @Hmclay35: so true like snp seem to forget tht more scots voted leave than they did snp in 2017 they do not speak for all of scotland
0.694 @JWalton12267995: same old, same old tories. remainer tories will still be remainer tories on 13.12, think on that!
0.694 @michael51846863: yes and labour in their manifesto 2017 promised brexit 💩💩💩
0.693 @i_robinsons: ann widdecombe is fantastic if the brexit party was to win i'd like to see her take number 10.
0.693 @parentchain: it will be his fault if this seat will be lost to labour or lib dems
0.693 @DIGADA1: why have you got no deal brexit in your name?  boris doesn't want a no deal brexit, does he.
0.692 @MartynDavid2: labour antisemitism row: public figures say they cannot vote for party under corbyn
0.692 @PhilipSephton: it's all tactical now i think that's the problem with a brexit election i think its gonna go to the wire
0.692 @LabourRedRose: you have no idea about far left then. i'll take labour over these tory liars.
0.691 @DMB12445: hollow laugh  take a look at boris deal - it does not stop free movement  vote brexit party
0.691 @JerryPa60351822: with any luck!! just hope old skool labour voters have woken up to this washed up unpeople party they have become !!!!!
0.691 @MaryLou4559: this is my traitorous mp..was labour then change now independent..full blown remainer
0.690 @MaryLou4559: unfortunately without a tory working majority leave government..we can't address this issue
0.690 @AmpersZA: no thanks, it will just be the usual lies, we know boris has no intention of leaving your eu masters.
0.690 @pjackso09793788: and your losing your seat. we have a fabulous bxp candidate set up to take it from you
0.689 @Julie34479: fraud  if mps get elected    must loose their seat
0.689 @jcjordansmith: just hoping boris stands down his people in the northern seats
0.689 @StVitusDance: dreadful  especially when brexit is certain to happen  they're so in brexit denial mode
0.688 @Kingotn01: you couldn't make this shit up.   why do you think 52% of the population voted for brexit  3 years ago?
0.688 @AlisonCar: is showing strong leadership &amp; a majority will bring a stringer #brexit  country is depending on you nigel. we need a  or  mp for every seat. dividing electorate will result in a #remoaner success. keep your eyes on the prize
0.688 @TraceyShephard4: # me to first time voting conservative  , labour  don't  support  the working class anymore .
0.687 @TBayfield: katie has gone soft on brexit, and trusts boris johnson's deal. that's quite worrying.
0.687 @Marco__Roth: which means democracy wont be affected!   whatever will peterborough labour do now?
0.687 @kevinb16199864: 1400 reasons to never vote labour
0.687 @AmpersZA: 17. 4 million leave voters.or are these the labour leave voters?
0.687 @PaulGra37564841: and there's a lot of remainers in the tory party.
0.686 @MRL8899: it's reform the uk parliament so we went stick with labour and tory's anymore... idiot
0.686 @PeterDu43948576: he’ll disappear along with corbyn and the labour party after the election. he’s a repulsive twat.
0.686 @Bulldog665: lib dems accused of misleading voters over rees-mogg's seat - 'how are they allowed?'
0.685 @markL201: yeah because labour are the communist party communists will work for election of left-led labour government
0.685 @MarkWebster_QC: claire, may i ask, roughly, how many seat do you honestly think the bxp will win and which ones?
0.684 @0_politics2: that’s not good, almost irrelevant who you vote for in that seat unfortunately
0.684 @CotswoldsWorcs: it won’t, choice between brexit and benefits and #commiecorbyn promises in that part of b’ham it’s about brainer
0.684 @PaulSte67312330: labour= mass immigration  time to deal with labour at the ballot box
0.683 @Fred52093826: yipeee the gravy train may make its next stop, 🗣️ all remoaner mp's who played a part in thwarting brexit please disembark on the 12th dec so we can board the next lot of new corrupt, deceitful mp's, thank you, this has been a party political broadcast on behalf of the public.
0.683 @theorphanmoon68: lot of moaning from both sides about boris's let's get brexit done...  ...you either want it done or you don't
0.682 @PearlCo24412937: stupid woman , so if we vote leave again you still won’t be satisfied
0.682 @davidebartoli6: on the whole, the eu is desperate for us to leave... they’ve spent millions preparing for no deal for the last 3.5 years and are keen to make an example of us to warn any other member states off leaving. it’s only this remoaner parliament standing in our way.
0.682 @Freedom79701412: wheras with your hatred of jews we can see you are no different to the other corbyn labour mps
0.681 @KevinHo98285195: corbyn will never stop his parties anti-semitism as he wants the muslim vote, simples!!😱😱🇬🇧🇬🇧

0.787 @Jw96934043: shows how vulnerable we are to a remain alliance unless nigel stops his ego trip
0.785 @bigo93: but with a pact may the tories would see that with the  mps, who will be elected, as allies they can force the eu to give us a good deal, or we really will leave with a clean break!  the eu have no reason to compromise when we have remoaner saboteurs!
0.782 @Madmonk41432125: not far right we just voted to leave the eu, does this mean remainers are all far left?
0.770 @Remoaner_Wolf: if you weren't so brainwashed you'd realise i'm doing the exact same opposite of what you claim. i'm putting brexit (and therefore country) before any party. we may need to hold our noses at some parts of the withdrawal agreement (that only lasts 14 months) to get this through.
0.768 @ba19974: come on burnley vote  and get brexit! don’t split the vote, #nevercorbyn
0.764 @EddiesSay: then you don't want brexit. if you can't vote for the brexit party you won't vote at all. absurd.
0.764 @Phil_Nourse: yes. current non tory seats. smart plan. will allow a boris majority but mitigate it being too big
0.764 @smileamilewide: no more harman. ever. £145k salary &amp; that’s the best we have? i am allergic to any more remoaner mp’s in charge. i had no problem with may being pm whatsoever, infact i voted for her. she then commited the most heinous crime - her wa. looks like bj is doing the same. vote nigel.
0.757 @SWso155: people would still vote labour if they made it policy for everybody who voted leave to take in a refugee.
0.755 @kenobifan1977: you’d be saying exactly the opposite had they simply ignored it. as dup and westminster tried to.
0.755 @CruellaDeBrexit: plenty of remainers are going to flock to libdem there. their vote will be drastically split. ids will get through
0.748 @IlicGill: vote tory if you want to leave the eu.
0.741 @english_longbow: it's over for #brexit.  england must leave the uk to get an automatic #engxit from the eu with no trade deal or exit bill.
0.741 @packetsniffer99: yes. it’s that simple. every vote for the brexit party is a vote for corbyn.
0.740 @UKAnglosphere: it might be a hard brexit to you  but to us who actually voted for brexit millions of us see it as a soft brexit.
0.739 @jjasq: nigel farage warned he has 48 hours to save brexit as leave donors call for more general election compromise
0.739 @NigelFinlay5: he's going to give us brino disappointing 17.4million leave voters

0.738 @PaulSte67312330: because boris's deal means with leave the eu, that's why
0.737 @MaryLou4559: that happens when we have a majority tory government..no deal is still default position 31st jan
0.737 @geoffomitchell: westminster is a complete shambles due to the cynical attempts by remoaners to thwart #brexit.  all we can do in chesterfield, if we ever get a general election, is kick out remoaner
0.733 @JustineClaire65: half of all labour candidates have pledged to ignore the referendum result
0.732 @EscapeEUSlavery: bye bye chucky   couldn't happen to a nicer remain traitor.   which party next ?!😂😂😂👍
0.732 @michelleallar17: i’m voting conservative as have a leave mp and the fear of corbyn in government is much worse than leave for me anyway
0.731 @JoJacob60080636: a vote for tory or liebour is a vote for the eu!!
0.731 @KeithTh44538358: should be taking the fight to all remain mps whatever their party.
0.730 @Manxman2602: what does that have to do with it? this poll is enough to tell you how people feel. brexit is a powder keg and it has been dragged out by remoaner politicians. therefore they are responsible for the continuation of this powder keg.
0.727 @UrbanWordsmith: too big an "if". as long as his rehash of may's treaty is still an option many leavers will not trust him.
0.726 @Whorulesme: this is the kind of exchange i've been involved in before.  #remoaner (rm): its the fault of the erg mays deal was voted down 3 times. me: but all other parties voted it it down too. rm: yeah but it's only the erg's fault. me: why? if other parties didn't it would pass. rm: err
0.726 @Dobunicus: 1. and the way certainly not to respond is to use the kind of language against boris that plays right into the remoaner hands. remember - bxp didn’t do as well as it should have done in euros, nor peterborough and the referendum was narrowly won
0.722 @MarkusW77550584: and pray tell just how will no deal happen with corbyn in n10 with the support of the snp and the lib dems?
0.721 @TaraJewell6: election: brexit party to take on 'all the remainers' says farage
0.720 @PaulSte67312330: we already voted for real change in 2016 but labour blocked brexit with labour's surrender act
0.716 @btahhh: is it because he's offering us brino, which is closer to staying in the eu than leaving!
0.715 @mickmurf68: its a sham of a second referendum most leavers would be without a viable option
0.708 @Jacquel53085745: that’s the u.k. future if we remain in the eu complete domination of the people
0.707 @PaulSte67312330: labour hate brexit voters as well
0.706 @Mr_Brad_I_Am: i won't respect the outcome of a remoaner's vote.  i will respect the outcome of a general election.  so no, i don't agree with dominic grievous.
0.706 @RuleBrexitannia: first thoughts on that are 43% of people really going to vote labour? i would say a large chunk of that vote will go bxp.
0.706 @OxfordeastB: just like remainer may and 'brexit means brexit' when she really meant it to mean remain.
0.705 @DWBCFC: don't get complacent we have to win first and a majority a hung parliament will be a corbyn rainbow coalition
0.704 @Ann06957684: i learnt never to trust a remoaner, they don't accept the results in a democratic country.
0.704 @rodbishop15: er......we’re leaving if you back boris. if not you’ll get corbyn and the eu.
0.702 @Brexitbrexit4: i think this is a remoaner troll, brexiteer normally have more follower and are not this stupid we dont want labour in no matter what. plz all leavers block this person and let's work together to get a brexit parliment.
0.701 @PaulSte67312330: don't take the fu#king pi#s, its sh#t like this that makes tactically tory voters not want to vote, so stfu
0.701 @reals_b4_feels: remoaner mps : boris deal is 95% the same as may's withdrawal agreement.  also remoaner mps : we need more time to read the agreement  #brexit #parliament
0.701 @Marmy35056438: when boris delivers brexit free of eu forever then we'll believe him, his may/ merkel treaty is not brexit. its brino.😏🇬🇧
0.700 @sparkz42: good news for boris! data shows ‘really big collapse’ of labour vote in the north
0.700 @OpinionsMove: but we would have to agree to it, which no government, conservative or labour would.
0.694 @TheDisillusion4: remember who bankrupted the country last time  ! labour and they'll do it again.  vote anyone but labour.
0.693 @BrexitComming: dont think we can keep them out but hopefully the brexit party will keep them honest  !
0.693 @screamingspuds: voted against no deal, and supported the may brino. he is a remainer at heart
0.693 @Craig4Patriots: they were to stubborn to make a pact with the bxp and now they're worried.🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
0.689 @sunick51: parliament blocked boris. he did exactly what he said he would do. and do you know who we blame? you and the rest of the remoaner parliament
0.689 @stevew2651: three years and parliament still want to keep us allied to the fourth reich eu dictatorship. its a disgrace!!
0.688 @_KickCass: i’m no tory but voting for boris! only way to keep jc out unfortunately
0.687 @Lordbrexit: polls are used to manipulate people by the mainstream media.  vote with your heart for the brexit party.
0.687 @RichardNorthey: i’m desperately hoping labour win fewer than 200 seats.
0.687 @Angela_C00k: vote tory . boris will get us a brilliant deal or he will go no deal . boris is a smart negotiator...
0.687 @greatpoets: the tories are offering vassalage not brexit  so why support the lying toe rags.
0.686 @wilma19504412: and this is the alternative, no thank you. apologise to your leave voters you fraudulently stole 🙄
0.686 @lost_in_sussex: it is a fact that anyone who votes labour under this "leadership" is either terminally stupid or morally bankrupt.
0.684 @madpiersfan: democracy is being fought for in hong kong and anyone who votes against brexit has absolutely no idea how lucky we are to have it!!
0.684 @simone_nugent: salford deserves better than anti-democratic liars. vote labour out.
0.682 @YeovilVoter: johnsons deal is brino. did you not know what you were voting for?
0.682 @MyNowt: sounds like you want to leave the seat with anna soubry? maybe labour will oust her for us.
0.681 @Jeff_Round: breaking, in a recent twitter poll, 100% of people asked said they where voting for a leave supporting party.
0.681 @SMITHYWS: not the leaving the eu per se the wa has clauses with lasting effect. i dislike it i dont see why we need the wa at all
0.680 @matthar19050956: dodgy policy with 16.8 million pro eu idiots still about....
0.679 @pam30301: we will never let bigoted antisemites win, we must move to destroy the labour party for good.
0.678 @Jacamo44031085: conservative as i voted to leave the eu.
0.677 @johndmtb: anything to try and discredit boris and stop brexit.
0.672 @TonyBan28639770: if boris gets a big enough majority the eu won't be calling the shots.
0.667 @CotswoldsWorcs: the brexit party won’t pick up seats, that’s the point
0.664 @redballoonsue: yes it was. i call myself a remoaner sometimes too.  after all, i moan enough!  i was just relieved that people i thought would have voted leave hadn't or they would not have suggested it.
0.662 @chuckmiddleton: not all jewish people vote, or vote for one party or another. my point being, that the uk jewish leader, supports boris...
0.662 @AthenaLeave: are the real alternative to labour in many seats the  have never won!
0.661 @GutteridgeLinda: omg this is the last straw, this is stupid now.if anybody at all votes for corbyn,  down with with labour
